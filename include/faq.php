We provide information on where to purchase or order a uniform after you enroll. Additionally, you might need to wear protective gear such as mouthguards, shin guards, and hand protectors, which can also be discussed during your enrollment process.

                         Our goal is to ensure you’re comfortable and well-prepared for class, so feel free to ask us any questions about attire and gear!</section>
